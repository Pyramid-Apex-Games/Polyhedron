# Polyhedron
Polyhedron is an attempt at taking the [Tesseract Engine](http://tesseract.gg) and turning it into a modable game engine. The core concept is that each map, provides a game on its own. Allowing for extreme modability using Python 3.

It will as time progresses include scripting with Python, no more CubeScript! (Hurray), new user interface (ImGUI and Nuklear UI), rewritten entity system inspired by HLSDK and Source SDK. A new editor interface. AI which also works in multiplayer.
